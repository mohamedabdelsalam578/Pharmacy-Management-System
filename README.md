## Wallet Payment System
The EL-TA3BAN Pharmacy System features a comprehensive wallet-based payment system:

- **Patient Wallet**: Each patient has a personal wallet with:
  - Balance tracking
  - Transaction history
  - Deposit functionality
  - Payment processing

- **Security Features**:
  - Transaction logs with timestamps
  - Credit card integration with secure number masking
  - Balance validation to prevent overdrafts

- **Payment Options**:
  - Direct wallet payment
  - Credit card payment for orders
  - Transaction receipts

- **Functionality**:
  - Patients can deposit funds to their wallet
  - Pay for medicine orders directly from wallet
  - View complete transaction history
  - Link credit cards for payment

## Data Persistence
All data is stored in text files in the `/data` directory:
- admins.txt: Admin user data
- patients.txt: Patient user data
- doctors.txt: Doctor user data
- pharmacists.txt: Pharmacist user data
- medicines.txt: Medicine inventory data
- orders.txt: Order transaction data
- prescriptions.txt: Prescription data
- medical_reports.txt: Medical report data
- consultations.txt: Doctor-patient consultation data
- messages.txt: Communication messages data
- wallet_transactions.txt: Patient wallet transaction data

## Main Classes
- **PharmacyManagementSystem**: Entry point to the application that automatically runs in extended mode
- **User**: Abstract base class for all user types (Admin, Patient, Doctor, Pharmacist)
- **Medicine**: Represents medicine items in the pharmacy inventory
- **Prescription**: Represents medical prescriptions created by doctors
- **Order**: Represents patient medicine orders
- **MedicalReport**: Stores patient medical information and diagnosis
- **Consultation**: Manages doctor-patient consultations
- **Pharmacy**: Central class representing the pharmacy entity
- **PharmacyService**: Main service integrating all user operations with complete healthcare workflow
- **AuthenticationService**: Handles secure user authentication with password hashing and login attempt limiting
- **Wallet**: Manages patient wallet functionality for secure in-app payments
- **CreditCard**: Handles credit card functionality with secure number masking
- **ConsoleUI**: Provides colorful and interactive console UI elements with emojis and text formatting

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
This project was designed as an educational tool to demonstrate core OOP principles:

### 1. Inheritance
- **Class Hierarchy**: User (parent) ‚Üí Admin, Patient, Doctor, Pharmacist (children)
- **Benefits**: Code reuse, extending functionality while maintaining common features
- **Example**: All user types inherit authentication and basic user attributes

### 2. Encapsulation
- **Data Protection**: Private fields with public getters/setters across all classes
- **Benefits**: Controlled access to data, validation of inputs, data integrity
- **Example**: Medicine class protects price, quantity and expiration data

### 3. Polymorphism
- **Method Overriding**: Each user type implements displayInfo() differently
- **Benefits**: Dynamic behavior at runtime, flexible code structure
- **Example**: Calling displayInfo() on any User reference shows role-specific information

### 4. Abstraction
- **Abstract Classes**: User class is abstract with concrete implementations
- **Benefits**: Enforces structure while hiding implementation details
- **Example**: Centralizes authentication but leaves specific behaviors to subclasses

### 5. Association Relationships
- **Composition**: Strong ownership (Patient owns Orders)
- **Aggregation**: Weaker relationships (Orders contain references to Medicines)
- **Benefits**: Models real-world relationships accurately
- **Example**: Prescription aggregates multiple Medicine objects

### 6. Modern Java Features
- **Streams API**: Used for efficient collection processing
- **Functional Programming**: Lambda expressions for concise code
- **Method References**: For cleaner callback implementation
- **Benefits**: More readable and maintainable code
- **Example**: calculateTotalCost() in Prescription uses stream processing

## Documentation Generation
The system includes an automated documentation generation feature that creates comprehensive Markdown documentation about the entire system:

### How It Works
- Access the documentation feature from the main menu (option 6)
- The system dynamically analyzes the current state of all components
- Documentation is generated as a Markdown file in the `/docs` directory
- Each documentation file includes:
  - System overview and architecture
  - Detailed class descriptions and relationships
  - Service layer explanations
  - Data flow diagrams using ASCII art
  - Current system statistics
  - Healthcare workflow explanation

### Benefits
- Always up-to-date documentation that reflects the current system state
- Comprehensive overview for new developers joining the project
- Educational tool showing real-world software documentation practices
- Useful reference for understanding the system architecture
- Markdown format for easy reading and version control

## Interactive Console UI
The EL-TA3BAN Pharmacy System features an enhanced console user interface with:

- **Color Formatting**: Colorful text output for better visual appeal
  - Success messages in green
  - Warnings in yellow
  - Errors in red
  - Titles and headers in bold blue

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Loading spinners for processing operations
  - Progress bars for multi-step operations
  - Boxed UI elements with Unicode borders
  - Table formatting for data display

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Emojis for visual context (üîç for search, üíä for medicines, etc.)
  - Animated transitions between screens
  - Styled menus with clear navigation options

The UI elements are implemented through the ConsoleUI utility class which provides a standardized interface for all system components to use.

## Educational Comments
Throughout the codebase, you'll find detailed educational comments explaining:
- Object-oriented design principles applied in each class
- The reasoning behind design decisions
- Real-world analogies to software concepts
- Egyptian localization aspects and cultural references

These comments make the code not just functional but a learning tool for Java and OOP concepts.
