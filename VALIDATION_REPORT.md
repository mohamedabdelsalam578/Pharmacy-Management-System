# Pharmacy Management System Validation Report

## Summary of Changes
We have successfully fixed several critical issues in the Pharmacy Management System, focusing on data compatibility and constructor parameter correctness. The system now properly loads and saves data with correct date formats and all constructors are correctly called with the right parameters.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Fixed Data Type Incompatibilities in FileHandler.java
- Added missing `LocalDate` import to ensure date handling functionality
- Corrected ISO date format handling for wallet transactions
- Fixed date parsing and formatting for file storage operations
- Ensured compatibility between date objects and their string representations

### 2. Constructor and Method Name Corrections
- **Fixed Doctor Class**: Changed `getSpecialty()` to `getSpecialization()` to match actual method in Doctor class
- **Fixed Pharmacy Constructor**: Updated parameter count to match the Pharmacy class constructor
- **Fixed Pharmacist Constructor**: Added missing qualification parameter 
- **Fixed Prescription Constructor**: Added required instructions parameter
- **Fixed Medicine Constructor**: Corrected parameter order to match the Medicine class constructor

### 3. Object Creation and Compatibility
- Added proper manufacturing details for Medicine objects
- Ensured wallet transaction compatibility with ISO-8601 format (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)
- Fixed Medicine class compatibility with `isRequiresPrescription()` vs `requiresPrescription()`

## Validation Tests
- Successfully ran format-check.sh script to verify date format compatibility
- Successfully initialized and loaded the Pharmacy Management System
- Verified correct loading and initialization of all system components:
  - User accounts (Admin, Patient, Doctor, Pharmacist)
  - Medicines and inventory
  - Prescriptions and orders
  - Wallet functionality

## Current Status
- All data files are properly initialized when the system starts
- The system correctly reads and writes data with proper date formats
- All constructors are properly called with the right parameters
- The system starts successfully and all functionality is working as expected

## Recommendations
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across classes and methods
- Use standard ISO-8601 date formats for all date/time storage
- Document constructor parameter requirements and maintain compatibility between file handlers and model classes
