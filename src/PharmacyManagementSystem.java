/**
 * 🏥 Welcome to the Pharmacy Management System! 🏥
 * 
 * Hello TA and team members! This is a comprehensive pharmacy system I built using
 * Object-Oriented Programming principles we learned in class. Here's what's special about it:
 * 
 * ✅ Complete Healthcare Workflow:
 *    - Connects patients, doctors, and pharmacists in one integrated system
 *    - Features Egyptian localization with local names, medicines, and currency (LE)
 *    - Maintains data even when you exit the program (using file-based storage)
 * 
 * ✅ OOP Concepts Applied:
 *    - Inheritance hierarchy with User as parent class and specialized roles as child classes
 *    - Encapsulation to protect data with private fields and accessor methods
 *    - Polymorphism through role-specific behaviors in different user types
 *    - Abstraction with service layers that handle business logic separately from models
 * 
 * ✅ Main Features:
 *    - Admin functionalities: manage medicines, view reports, add/remove users
 *    - Patient functionalities: create account, order medicines, view prescriptions
 *    - Doctor functionalities: create prescriptions and medical reports for patients
 *    - Pharmacist functionalities: fill prescriptions, manage pharmacy inventory
 * 
 * ✅ Two Operation Modes:
 *    - Extended Mode (Default): Complete healthcare workflow with all features
 *    - Basic Mode: Standard pharmacy operations (use --basic parameter if needed)
 * 
 * The project is structured in packages to maintain clean separation of concerns:
 *    - models: Data structures representing real-world entities
 *    - services: Business logic for different system roles
 *    - utils: Helper classes for data handling and initialization
 * 
 * Test credentials:
 *    - Admin: username "admin", password "admin123"
 *    - Patient: username "amr", password "alice123"
 *    - Doctor: username "drmohamed", password "doctor123"
 *    - Pharmacist: username "fatima", password "pharm123"
