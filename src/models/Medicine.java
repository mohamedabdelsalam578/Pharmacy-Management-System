 * üíä Medicine - Core entity representing pharmaceutical products
 * 
 * This class represents medications within the pharmacy system and
 * stores all relevant product information including pricing, inventory,
 * and prescription requirements.
 * 
 * üîë Class Responsibilities:
 * - Store complete medication information (name, price, etc.)
 * - Track inventory quantities through stock management methods
 * - Enforce prescription requirements for controlled substances
 * - Provide formatted display of medicine information
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è Design Patterns & Principles:
 * - Encapsulation: All fields are private with public getters/setters
 * - Information Expert: Contains all data and behavior related to medicines
 * - Entity Object: Represents a primary domain model in the system
 * 
 * üîÑ Relationships:
 * - Used by Pharmacy to maintain inventory
