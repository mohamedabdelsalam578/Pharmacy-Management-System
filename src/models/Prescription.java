/**
 * üíä Prescription - The bridge between doctors, patients, and pharmacists üíä
 * 
 * This class is a critical connector in our healthcare workflow! It represents a real-world
 * prescription that travels from doctors to pharmacists to patients, demonstrating how
 * object-oriented design mirrors real-world interactions.
 * 
 * üîë Key Features and OOP Concepts:
 * - Composition: Uses a HashMap to store Medicine objects (Has-A relationship)
 * - Data validation: Ensures quantities are positive before adding medicines
 * - Encapsulation: Private data with controlled access via methods
 * - Real-world modeling: Tracks lifecycle states (Pending ‚Üí Filled ‚Üí Expired)
 * 
 * üìã Workflow Representation:
 * 1. Doctor creates a Prescription for a Patient (issueDate, expiryDate)
 * 2. Doctor adds medicines with dosage instructions
 * 3. Prescription is sent to Pharmacy (status changes)
 * 4. Pharmacist processes the Prescription (more status changes)
 * 5. Patient receives the filled Prescription
 * 
 * üí° This class demonstrates applying software design to real-world processes!
