/**
 * ðŸ‘¤ User - The foundation of our system's class hierarchy ðŸ‘¤
 * 
 * This abstract class demonstrates the OOP concept of inheritance by serving
 * as the parent class for all user types in our pharmacy system.
 * 
 * ðŸ”‘ OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
 * - Abstraction: User class cannot be instantiated directly (it's abstract!)
 * - Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters/setters protect our data
 * - Inheritance: Admin, Patient, Doctor, and Pharmacist all inherit from User
 * - Polymorphism: The displayInfo() method behaves differently for each user type
 * 
 * ðŸ“š Class Responsibilities:
 * - Provides common attributes for all user types (id, name, credentials, etc.)
 * - Enforces a consistent interface across different user roles
 * - Centralizes authentication-related data for the whole system
 * 
 * This is a great example of how we apply the "is-a" relationship in OOP.
 * For example, a Doctor "is-a" User with additional doctor-specific properties.

    /**
     * ðŸ”„ Abstract method to display information about a user (Polymorphism in action!)
     * 
     * This is a perfect example of polymorphism - one of the four pillars of OOP.
     * Each subclass (Admin, Patient, Doctor, Pharmacist) will override this method
     * to display role-specific information, but they can all be called through a
     * common User interface.
     * 
     * When we call displayInfo() on different User objects, the program automatically
     * knows which version to call based on the actual object type at runtime. That's
     * dynamic polymorphism!
     * 
     * For example:
     * - Admin will display administrative privileges and system access level
     * - Patient will display medical history and current prescriptions
     * - Doctor will display specialization and patient count
     * - Pharmacist will display their pharmacy branch and qualification
